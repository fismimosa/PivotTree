# PivotTree

This repository contains the code for PivotTree in the context of RuleTree as Decision Tree Framework


```validation``` and ```testing``` and respectively include code to run testing and validation experiments. Ensure to run the ```.py``` validation and testing file in the same folder containing ```RuleTree``` folder for proper running or modify the import in the code above to perform stumps and utils import


```BoundaryVisualization.ipynb``` shows code with deptiction of differnet boundary of univariate, oblique and proximity based splits for different versions of ```PivotTree```

```TimeSeriesVisualization.ipynb``` shows code of training univariate and proximity based splits for ```gun``` dataset for the time-sereis qualitative example reported. Similar code is used for ```cifar10``` and ```oral``` datasets as examples depicted in the relative paper
